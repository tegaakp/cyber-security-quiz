# Cyber-Security-quiz

## Introduction


This cybersecurity quiz is a minimum viable product (MVP) designed for early‑career professionals joining the organisation. Its purpose is to introduce new hires to essential cybersecurity practices, reinforce internal standards, and promote strong data protection and privacy habits across all levels of the organisation.

All data used in this quiz is synthetic and intentionally simplified to support beginner‑level learning and ensure a safe, controlled training environment.

This cyber security app is a desktop application that uses [Python](https://www.python.org/0), [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/902667414815738345/recents-and-sharing?fuid=1560570689866732652). The quiz collects the user’s unique ID passcode to generate a personalised set of security questions. This helps new joiners learn how to stay safe online and protect the organisation’s assets through practical, beginner‑friendly scenarios.
