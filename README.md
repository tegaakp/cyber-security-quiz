# Cyber-Security-quiz

## Introduction


This cybersecurity quiz is a minimum viable product (MVP) designed for early‑career professionals joining the organisation. Its purpose is to introduce new hires to essential cybersecurity practices, reinforce internal standards, and promote strong data protection and privacy habits across all levels of the organisation.

All data used in this quiz is synthetic and intentionally simplified to support beginner‑level learning and ensure a safe, controlled training environment.

This cyber security app is a desktop application that uses [Python](https://www.python.org/0), [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/902667414815738345/recents-and-sharing?fuid=1560570689866732652). The quiz collects the user’s unique ID passcode to generate a personalised set of security questions. This helps new joiners learn how to stay safe online and protect the organisation’s assets through practical, beginner‑friendly scenarios.

## DESIGN

In this section, we focus on the design of the quiz interface. The graphical user interface (GUI) was created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/902667414815738345/recents-and-sharing?fuid=1560570689866732652) , which was used to plan and organise how the quiz looks and behaves before development. The design shows the layout, button placement, question screens, and overall structure to ensure the experience is clear and easy to follow. Figure 1 illustrates the user flow from a front-end perspective, meaning it represents what users will actually see and interact with in the final version. This includes how users move between questions, enter their answers, receive validation messages, and progress through the quiz in a logical and structured way. The aim of the design is to provide a simple, intuitive, and user-friendly experience for all users.
